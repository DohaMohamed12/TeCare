# 🏥 TeCare: The Digital Fortress for Healthcare

**TeCare** is a comprehensive cybersecurity capstone project designed to secure smart healthcare environments. Inspired by the vision of **Dr. Ahmed** (the hospital manager), we transformed a vulnerable medical network—where "being connected meant being targeted"—into a battle-ready **Digital Fortress**.

## 📖 The Story
In a world where IoT devices and Electronic Medical Records (EMR) save lives, they also create critical vulnerabilities. Dr. Ahmed faced the challenge of protecting patient sanctity in a digital landscape. Our team stepped in as Cybersecurity Engineers to map, attack, and ultimately defend TeCare Hospital.

## 🛠️ Project Phases

### 1. Mapping the Kingdom (Risk Analysis) 🗺️
Before defending, we had to understand the terrain.
* **Asset Discovery:** Identified critical infrastructure, from IoT patient monitors to the EMR database.
* **Role Definition:** Categorized departments (HR, Labs, IT, Doctors) to establish a baseline for security.

### 2. The Storm (Offensive Operations) ⚡
We "thought like the enemy" to expose hidden cracks. Simulations included:
* **Spear Phishing:** Testing human awareness and entry points.
* **SQL Injection:** Attempting unauthorized access to sensitive patient medications and diagnoses.
* **IoT Exploitation:** Executing **ARP Spoofing & Brute Force** attacks to hijack vital sign monitors.

### 3. The Shield (Defensive Operations) 🛡️
We sealed the holes by engineering a robust defense-in-depth strategy:
* **Active Directory (AD):** Built a centralized hierarchy for the entire hospital.
* **Identity & Access Management (IAM):** Implemented the **Principle of Least Privilege**.
* **Group Policy (GPOs):** Automated security rules including password complexity, USB blocking, and account lockouts.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Tools
* **Directory Services:** Microsoft Active Directory.
* **Penetration Testing:** Kali Linux (Metasploit, SQLMap, Wireshark).
* **Infrastructure:** Windows Server, Virtualization (VMware/VirtualBox).
* **Defense:** GPO Management, Network Segmentation.
